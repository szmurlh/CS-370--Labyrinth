# CS-370--Labyrinth


# Jonny, 8/28
I created a Java workspace and added the Lightweight Java Game Library (LWJGL). I took the code from the "Getting Started" page on lwjgl.org/guide as a starting template for making the game. This gives us a simple window. I also created some sample sprites for the main tiles in the game.
